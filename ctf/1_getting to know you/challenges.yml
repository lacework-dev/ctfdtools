    The CISO just agreed to present rolling updates on the new vulnerability management program to the board of directors over the next quarter. For the next update, the CISO wants to highlight a particular host that has been prioritized to be the top work item using Lacework data.  Which means, someone is now responsible for identifying the host that will be showcased in the CISO's next report. Any guesses on who that person is?
